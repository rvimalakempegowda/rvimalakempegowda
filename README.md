## 📜 Pinned repositories

You can pin repositories on your GitHub profile to showcase your best work. Based on my current portfolio, I recommend pinning:

1. **Amazon_clone** – demonstrates full‑stack development skills.
2. **React_Food_App** – highlights frontend expertise and real‑time database integration.
3. **each_stock_earning_date** – shows data scraping and analysis with Python.
4. **reinforcement_Learning_A2C** – exhibits machine learning and RL experimentation.

## 💡 Best Practices

To keep this profile effective:

- Update the “Current focus” section as your interests evolve. Regularly refresh pinned projects so visitors see your latest work.
- Keep your personal site/portfolio and LinkedIn links up to date. Include a contact email or portfolio link so people can reach you easily.
- Use a consistent and clean layout with clear sections, and avoid overwhelming readers with too much text.

    Thanks for stopping by! ✨
